                <h2>Interest in IT:</h2>
                <p>My interest first began as a boy growing up on a farm in Cairns. My friend's older
                    brothers had, what was at the time, high-tech computers. They would explain to me 
                    in detail about how the hardware worked, why it made the computer run smoothly,
                    what viruses were, and how to care for the computer. Over time, media such as The 
                    Matrix and other movies were released, which sparked my interest in programming. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During high school I took as many computer classes as I could. During this time
                    I learned BASIC programming, and robotics. We also took ethics in IT.
                    
                    After high school, I managed to land a job as a lead web developer for a company
                    that produced software for real estate agents. During this time I learned project
                    management, as well as Git skills, DNS management, and domain maintenance. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to enrol online at RMIT after deciding to engage in online university,
                    and after looking through the entire course syllabus, found that the Bachelor of
                    IT would produce the skill necessary to become a full stack developer. I was 
                    especially interested in the ability to learn Advanced Programming techniques
                    and learn the .NET framework, as there are many jobs available in this domain.

                <h3>Role Description: </h3>
                <p>The role advertised above is that of a Senior .NET developer. This means having experience
                    and expertise working within the Microsoft .NET framework, building web applications using
                    API's for getting and sending data, or building front end User Interfaces using the Razor pages.
                    This position would require a developer to have strong coding skills in the C# programming language,
                    and at least 5 years experience in a similar role and environment. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, although I have 4 years experience as a Web Developer, my time was largely spent
                    in project management or DNS management, so I would require much more time to develop my skilsl to
                    be able to fill a role such as this. However, I have spent time using the .NET framework as well
                    as the C# language, so I feel that I would be suited to a role like this in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan on developing these skills in the future via my university course work as well as private
                    projects.

            <h1>Project Parental Discounts</h1>
            <h3>Overview: </h3>
            <p>
                The overview of this project is to create a GUI based program that allows new or expectant parents
                to enter their location, select the items they’d like to be alerted for discounts,
                and have a custom made alert sent to their devices whenever these items are marked on special.
                This will therefore make online shopping for new parents less stressful, as their chosen items 
                (for example, baby formula) and brands will be scouring online resources like Amazon or Coles for 
                marked discounts, alerting them when they’re available for discounted purchase. This will overall 
                contain basic parental needs such as prams, baby formula, baby clothes (gender neutral or specific)
                ,toys, bassinets, car seats, wipes and nappies.
            </p>
            <h3>Motivation:</h3>
            <p>
                As a father of one (soon to be two) I often find myself having to purchase baby related items 
                on a whim, such as nappies, wipes or formula. While seeing discounts in store is useful, the 
                ability to know in advance when these items are on special would be much more handy, especially 
                if local stores are stocking only at full price. This program would seek to help resolve this 
                stress, and ease the plight of single or struggling parents, to whom financial woes are extremely 
                dangerous. In a world of decreasing stability and ever increasing crises, the ability to know when 
                essential baby products are affordable will be a huge relief to those currently undergoing 
                financial stress. 
            </p>
            <h3>Specifications:</h3>
            <p>
                First, the user would download the program, and be shown a Guided User Interface (GUI) that asks 
                them to enter their location (country, state, city/postcode). The user is then presented with 
                another checkbox displaying “Online”, which when indicated, includes online offers as well. 
                Afterwards, the user is taken to the second screen, which has a list of items they may select for 
                notification. These items include but are not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strollers/prams</li>
                <li>Nappies/diapers</li>
                <li>Wipes</li>
                <li>Formula</li>
                <li>Clothing</li>
                <li>Bottles</li>
                <li>Toys</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After the user has selected the items they wish to be notified on (some options, when selected, 
                may prompt the user to add more specifications, such as gender specific clothing or brand specific 
                formula), they will then be prompted as to how often they would like to receive notifications on 
                these specials. These options will be anything from daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly. 
                Consideration will be taken in the future for adding different notification options for specific 
                items such as formula, or toys, as needs shift.
            </p>
            <p>Once these options have been selected, the user will then be taken to the contact details screen, 
                which will capture their contact information in order to send them the notifications of when these 
                items go on special.
            </p>
            <p>The user should also be sent a verification email to ensure that they have received the correct 
                notification. 
            </p>
            <p>In future, there may be additional features added such as the ability to later customise the 
                notifications (remove items), change locations, change specific stores, request for stores to be 
                added, et cetera.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Tools and technologies:
            </h3>


            <h4>Hardware:</h4>
            <ul>
                 <li>Servers: Depending on the size of the user base, a server for hosting records may 
                be required, either virtual or physical.
                </li>
                <li>PC's: For writing the software required.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Software:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Database: A record of users and their notifications will be needed in order to store their information securely. </li>
                <li>API: An API will need to be created to send and receive users information to and from the GUI.</li>
                <li>Automation: A script will need to be written to create and customise the alerts.</li>
                <li>GUI: The Guided User Interface will need to be created in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.</li>
                <li>Mobile application: In future there will be the potential to create the program to run on mobular devices.</li>
                <li>Github: To keep a backed up account of all the software that will need to be written, a Github account will need to be created</li>
                <li>Google: In order to find the different stores for the beta testing, as well as notifications on online offers, Google pages will need to be scraped.</li>
                <li>Amazon: As the world’s leading online shopping company, Amazon will play a key role in the shipping and discounted offers of products. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Skills Required:</h3>
            <p>
                In order to undertake the creation of this project, an intermediate to advanced level of programming will be required, not only to create the frontend of the application but also the backend. Security measures will need to be put in place to protect the information of the users, so an understanding of these protocols is also required.
            </p>
            <p>
                An understanding of languages such as Python or C# would be most beneficial for these tasks, as these languages offer solid automation and project scaling, respectively. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Database quering, the likes of MYSQL would be a mandatory requirement in order to store the information of the users, their preferences, contact information, location, et cetera. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Networking and security knowledge are vital for the success of this project, as enough scaling would need to be done to ensure there is always room for more users, and that all users private information would be safely secured in a non-accessible way, which will require a sound understanding of web applications, databases, and server security measures and protocols. In future, if deployed to a mobile application, these measures and protocols will need to extend to mobile devices as well.
            </p>
            <h3>Outcomes:
            </h3>
            <p>
                The overall outcome and goal of this project is that the users of the program are able to rest more easily knowing that there are many affordable options in the world that they no longer have to search for. In the modern world, many people are time poor due to financial constraints, having the ability to simply open a program or their own emails and see the latest discounts on essential items would truly be much less burdensome to new or struggling parents. To be able to select, within a few minutes, which items are needed now or in the future, at affordable rates, would hopefully create less stress at home and within themselves, allowing them to enjoy more thoroughly the benefits of parenthood.
